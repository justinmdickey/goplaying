# Easter Egg Config: Spinning Vinyl Record Mode 🎵
#
# This is a hidden feature! Enable vinyl_mode to make the album artwork
# spin like a real record player when music is playing.
#
# The artwork will:
# - Rotate continuously when music is playing
# - Stop spinning when paused
# - Show a "33⅓ RPM" indicator with spinning animation
#
# To enable, add this to your ~/.config/goplaying/config.yaml:

ui:
  color: "2"
  color_mode: "auto"  # auto looks great with vinyl mode!
  max_width: 45

artwork:
  enabled: true
  padding: 15
  width_pixels: 300
  width_columns: 13
  vinyl_mode: true  # 🎵 Enable spinning vinyl record animation!
